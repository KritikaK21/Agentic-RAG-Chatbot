LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables chaining of LLM calls and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) from external sources. It is widely used for building chatbots, Q&A systems, and document search tools.

RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique that retrieves relevant documents from an external knowledge base and uses them as context for the language model to generate accurate, grounded answers.

LangChain supports multiple vector stores including FAISS, Chroma, and Pinecone. These vector stores allow efficient similarity search over embedded document chunks.

LangChain integrates with popular embedding models like OpenAI, Hugging Face, and Cohere. These models convert text into numerical vectors for semantic search.

LangChain can be used to build chatbots, Q&A systems, and document search tools. It is widely adopted for building production-grade AI applications.

LangChain allows developers to combine LLMs with memory, tools, and APIs. This enables building complex workflows where the model can remember past interactions and call external services.

LangChain agents use reasoning to choose tools and interact with users dynamically. Agents can decide which tool to use based on the user query and context.
