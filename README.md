# 🤖 Agentic RAG QA System — Multi-Format Document Intelligence

A production-inspired **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that answers natural-language questions from documents across multiple formats — PDF, DOCX, PPTX, CSV, and TXT.

Unlike typical monolithic RAG pipelines, this system uses an **agent-based architecture inspired by the Model Context Protocol (MCP)** — where each stage of the pipeline is a separate, communicating agent. This makes the system modular, debuggable, and closer to how real production AI systems are designed.

## 🚩 The Problem This Solves

Most RAG implementations are monolithic scripts — hard to debug, hard to extend, and far from production-ready.

This project answers: **what does a well-architected, agent-based RAG system actually look like in code?**

- You upload any combination of PDF, DOCX, PPTX, CSV, or TXT files
- The system parses, chunks, embeds, and indexes them automatically
- You ask questions in natural language
- Grounded, context-aware answers come back — with full traceability through structured agent messages

---

## ⚡ Key Features

- **Multi-format ingestion** — PDF, DOCX, PPTX, CSV, TXT parsed and normalised into a unified pipeline
- **Agent-based architecture** — Ingestion, Retrieval, and LLM Response agents with clean separation of concerns
- **MCP-style JSON message passing** — structured, traceable communication between agents
- **Semantic search** — sentence transformer embeddings + FAISS/Chroma vector store
- **Context-aware responses** — grounded LLM answers with retrieved chunks as context
- **Interactive Streamlit UI** — upload documents and query in real time
- **Configurable pipeline** — chunk size, overlap, top-k retrieval, and similarity threshold all tunable

## 🏗 System Architecture
```
User → Streamlit UI → Coordinator Agent
           ├── Ingestion Agent   → Parses, cleans & chunks documents
           ├── Retrieval Agent   → Embeds query & retrieves top-k chunks
           └── LLM Response Agent → Generates grounded final response
```

Agents communicate via **MCP-style structured JSON messages** — every interaction is typed, traced, and logged.

### Example Agent Message
```json
{
  "type": "CONTEXT_RESPONSE",
  "sender": "RetrievalAgent",
  "receiver": "LLMResponseAgent",
  "trace_id": "abc-123",
  "payload": {
    "top_chunks": ["..."],
    "query": "What are the KPIs?"
  }
}
```

## 🔍 Retrieval Pipeline
```
Upload → Parse → Chunk → Embed → Store in FAISS/Chroma
                                        ↓
Query → Embed → Similarity Search → Top-k Chunks → LLM → Answer
```

**Configurable parameters:**
- `CHUNK_SIZE` — token size per chunk (default: 500)
- `CHUNK_OVERLAP` — overlap between chunks (default: 50)
- `TOP_K` — number of chunks retrieved per query (default: 5)
- `SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` — minimum similarity score to include a chunk

## 💡 Why Agentic Over Monolithic?

Most RAG tutorials give you a single script. That works for demos — not for production.

| | Monolithic RAG | Agentic RAG (This Project) |
|---|---|---|
| Debugging | Hard — one big pipeline | Easy — isolate any agent |
| Extensibility | Risky changes | Swap agents independently |
| Observability | Limited | Full message tracing |
| Production readiness | Low | High |

## 🧪 Example Queries to Try

- *"Summarise the key findings across all uploaded documents"*
- *"What KPIs are mentioned in the reports?"*
- *"Extract all financial metrics from the uploaded files"*
- *"What recommendations are discussed across these documents?"*
